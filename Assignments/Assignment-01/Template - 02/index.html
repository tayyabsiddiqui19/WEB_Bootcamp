    <h1>Why Javascript ?</h1>
    <p>
      So, you’re thinking about JavaScript and why should you learn it, why
      <br />
      JavaScript when there are so many other languages out there, some have
      <br />
      been around for a while, they’re more mature, stable with settled and
      established <br />
      ecosystems of libraries, tools and other helpers and utilities. Other,
      newer <br />
      languages lure you in with fresh new ideas! So, why ’settle’ for what
      seems to <br />
      be (according to this misleading intro text) an ‘average’ programming
      language <br />
      with a chaotic ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, ideas and tools that
      change <br />
      every half hour? Well, as it turns out there are A LOT of exciting reasons
      to learn JavaScript! <br />
      <br />

      To explain someone why they should learn JavaScript we first need to
      <br />
      go over a few points:
      <br />
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>How ‘free’ and available is JavaScript?</li>
      <li>What’s it like to write code in JavaScript?</li>
      <li>Just how useful JavaScript actually is?</li>
      <li>How good are the tools that are used by JavaScript developers?</li>
      <li>What’s the JavaScript community like?</li>
      <li>Does JavaScript have a future?</li>
    </ul>
    Let’s start from the top

    <h2>How ‘free’ and available is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is one of the most open programming languages out there! <br />
      JavaScript has a standard that is closely followed by many <br />
      implementers ( specification: ECMA-262 is an ISO standard ) <br />
      On top of that, the advancement and evolution of the language is <br />
      handled by TC39 (https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm)
      <br />
      (GitHub: https://github.com/tc39) a committee that includes several <br />
      (in normal circumstances rival) companies and all major browser vendors
      <br />
      working together to make JavaScript the best possible language it can be.
      <br />
      That makes JavaScript’s ‘free-ness’ very clear, it’s in no danger <br />
      of being taken over by any single company or organization or whatever…
    </p>

    <h2>What’s it like to write code in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
      Answering this question is a bit tricky because of a number of factors.
      <br />
      The first point of discussion ( and arguing between developers ) is the
      <br />very nature of JavaScript, JavaScript is a very flexible language
      <br />allowing developers to write the style of code they prefer but it
      <br />
      doesn’t isolate them from other coding styles and their side effects.
      <br />
      This means that you can write JavaScript with OOP in mind ( I suggest
      <br />
      you don’t but you’ll do whatever you want anyway so what’s the point… )
      <br />
      but you can also mix in other styles in there with ease ( sometimes <br />
      unintentionally ) Some developers claim this is a weakness of the
      language, <br />
      that it’s undefined and the language doesn’t know what it wants to be so
      <br />
      everything is allowed and ultimately you can never write ‘pure’ code, on
      <br />
      the other hand some developers claim this is a benefit and opportunity
      <br />
      ( like I do ) because you can write code that BEST SUITS THE SITUATION!
    </p>

    <h2>Just how useful JavaScript actually is?</h2>
    <p>
      This question is REALLY easy to answer! <br />JavaScript is EVERYWHERE and
      the awesome part is that it’s just <br />getting warmed up! JavaScript
      started off very weak and not exactly <br />useful (when I started looking
      into the language JavaScript developers <br />were called ‘script kiddies’
      and not respected at all) and then <br />JavaScript started to evolve, you
      were suddenly able to do things! <br />
      Fresh new standards and ideas started to emerge, Angular<br />
      (https://angularjs.org/) hit the scene and you were no longer<br />
      building web sites that had a bit of JavaScript to spice things up,
      <br />you were building web apps! Also, (in my subjective opinion) the big
      <br />one hit NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/) (built on Google’s awesome V8
      engine <br />
      (https://developers.google.com/v8/) and it’s package manager NPM <br />
      (https://www.npmjs.com/) appeared and the whole programming scene <br />
      changed, out of nowhere JavaScript developers could do it all!
    </p>

    <h2>How good are the tools that are used by JavaScript developers?</h2>
    <p>
      This one is really subjective and depending on who you ask, the <br />
      JavaScript tools scene is either terrific or really catastrophic. <br />
      Personally, I’m leaning towards the latter at the time of writing <br />
      this post, because no matter what your JavaScript skill level is <br />
      you will have to put in work just to sort out what tools you’re <br />
      going to use. For beginners it ain’t easy because they’re going to <br />
      be attacked by an endless stream of names: gulp, grunt, bower, <br />
      browserify, webpack, rollup, coffeescript, typescript, VS Code, <br />
      github Atom, webstorm and the list goes on and on and on… <br />
      For veteran developers it’s an intense mental exercise to keep <br />
      up with what’s current and useful and what new ideas / tools <br />
      will be useful so they can focus on learning that new thing <br />
      and ignore the ‘noise’.
    </p>

    <h2>What’s the JavaScript community like?</h2>
    <p>
      This one is a mixed bag… the JavaScript community is strong <br />
      in numbers, really strong (http://githut.info) buuuuuut unfortunately
      <br />
      the average JavaScript developer doesn’t understand the language as <br />
      much as they should. This leads to new JavaScript developers looking
      <br />
      at those developers and thinking that skill level is the goal (I’ve <br />
      been on the JavaScript scene for 10+ years now and up until a few <br />
      years ago no tutorial or blog post I came across explained JavaScript
      <br />
      coercion correctly!) The good news here is that this is changing, <br />
      lots of quality JavaScript developers are emerging that took the <br />
      time necessary to learn JavaScript in depth and are now sharing <br />
      their knowledge freely and for the benefit of the JavaScript community
      <br />
      (https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). This will probably get
      <br />
      even better with time. The community and the language is maturing and more
      and <br />
      more JavaScript veterans are taking on the response
    </p>

    <h2>Does JavaScript have a future?</h2>
    <p>
      Taking everything into account it’s safe to say JavaScript has a nice
      <br />
      looking future in front of it. The ever evolving JavaScript standards
      <br />
      have already turned what was once considered a kiddie programming <br />
      language into a software development powerhouse. JavaScript has the <br />
      most active community out there, new things are constantly tested out
      <br />
      and adopted in a flash, shifting the entire mindset of the community
      <br />
      overnight, that level of flexibility in a dev community is unparalleled!
      <br />
      The Web, the platform in which JavaScript is a vital part is becoming
      <br />
      increasingly important and with it JavaScript as well. JavaScript is
      <br />
      supported and important to a lot of very large tech and non-tech
      companies.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is not perfect but at this point in time it’s hard to beat.
      <br />
      JavaScript simply can do everything, choosing JavaScript as your primary
      <br />
      programming language leaves you open to switch to whichever platform: web,
      <br />
      desktop, smartphone, IoT, etc. you fancy.You can’t exactly say the same
      for <br />
      most other programming languages. <br />
      <br />
      And after taking into account everything we talked about in this post we
      can <br />
      see that JavaScript developers will continue to be in high demand.
